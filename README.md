# ABOUT

- Languages used: Ruby and Javascript

- React Frontend

- [Rails Backend](https://github.com/Bearinawolfpack/backend_foster_fitness#readme)

- Postgresql(Database)

- Libraries used: React-Router, React-Bootstrap, and Sass to to get the hover color to white on the navbar (Refer to patch notes for plans to factor it out.)

- This is a template site for a small to medium size gym. It displays information about the gym including their schedule, workout, staff, location, events, and pricing. It also features admin controls to add, remove, and edit the coaches, events, workouts and services.

- The primary purpose of this site is to be used as a sales funnel to get information from new members. When ever a user submits the contact form found on every page of the website, a timestamp is added to the admin panel and an email is sent to the admin with the information the user put in allowing the admin move to the next step in the sales process.

## TO DO

- Add Captcha to sign_up form

- Transparent overlays for background images (look more into react styled components).

- "See More" Hyperlink, after the third coach, which links to the 'about us' page.

- Change Coach Card Body hover effect to an overlay.

- Refactor navbar.js so doesn't use style components (making it consistent with how the rest of the project is styled)

- Make it so that an image can be uploaded with the workout. Leave all fields optional, admin may want to upload a picture (from the web or locally) with the workout printed on it already.

- Make list of contacts show only the last 10. Have contact cards in a deck and give them a border. Have the archive of contacts prior to the last 10 be sortable.

- Change events_card.js link color from blue to #fcba03

- Find a different font to use for the site and use the different weights of that font where appropriate.

- Host on Heroku.
