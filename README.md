ABOUT:
==================================

- Languages used: Ruby and Javascript

- Stack used: React, Rails and Postgresql

- Libraries used: React-Router and React-Bootstrap

- This is a template site for a small to medium size gym. It displays information about the gym including their schedule, workout, staff, location, events, and pricing. It also features admin controls to add, remove, and edit the coaches, events, workouts and services.

- The primary purpose of this site is to be used as a sales funnel to get information from new members. When ever a user submits the contact form found on every page of the website, a timestamp is added to the admin panel and an email is sent to the admin with the information the user put in allowing the admin move to the next step in the sales process.

    -   I really interested in trying out the gym but I'll only be able to make it on the weekend. Do you guys have a 'weekend warrior' type of membership? I saw the punchcard has 8 classes, I'm ok with that but i'd rather have a monthly that I could set and forget.
