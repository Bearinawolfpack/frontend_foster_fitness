  - I really interested in trying out the gym but I'll only be able to make it on the weekend. Do you guys have a 'weekend warrior' type of membership? I saw the punchcard has 8 classes, I'm ok with that but i'd rather have a monthly that I could set and forget.

<Card style={{ width: '18rem' }}>
  <Card.Img variant="top" src="holder.js/100px180" />
  <Card.Body>
    <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>
      Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of
      the card's content.
